Old script has written to include python libraries if missing.. need to check the code and enhance/modify depend on need
Argument parser like -aul_upgrade -vib_install ..Module wise execution with arg passing  like only upgrade , install/uninstall etc for user convient as well it helps 
      in quick code check
all exceptions should cover without getting code error 
common config file across platform
common library for installation (by passing yes and password ) and download/upload file
Eliminate hardcodings (like c folder etc) 
Log should be created with logging info in user directory or common location. 
    like /users/userid or arg parser can use  so that it will help in understanding the errors occured and include exceptions in code optimization
